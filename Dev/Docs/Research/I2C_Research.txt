-SDAx and SCLx must have an open drain
	-because they are bi-directional
	-both lines are open drain

-speeds
	-10kbits 	low speed mode
	-100kbits	high speed mode
	-400kbits	fast mode
	-1Mbits		fast mode plus
	-3.4Mbits	High speed 

-however these speeds include overheads such as (not actual data transmission)
	-slave address
	-maybe a register address
	-per byte ACK/NACK bits (which probably means some sort of acknowledge thing)

-nodes
	-limited by the address space

-transmission distance
	-the bus has a total capacitance of 400pF
		-which limits comms to a few meters (I though it was inches)

-master and slave
	-master node

-addressing
	-7 bit
	-10 bit
	-16 bit on some devices
	-each device has an address

-clock stretching provides delays so processor can respond to slave data request

-transmission
	-when master needs to initiate a data transfer
		-it transmits the address of the device that it wants to talk to
		-within this address BIT 0 specifies if master wants to read or write

-bus protocol
	-data transfer initiated only when bus is not busy
	-start
		-all data transfers must be preceded by a start condition
			-start condition
				-after bus idle state
				-a high to low on data lone while clock is high
	-stop
		-low to high of the data line while clock is high
			-is a stop condition
		-all data transfers must end with a stop condition
	-repeated start
		-after a wait state
			-sending a start condition again
				-constitutes a repeated start condition
		-this allows master to do more stuff without giving up control of the bus
	-data valid
		-after a start condition
		-the state of the data line represents valid data
			-when the data line is stable for the duration of the high period of the clock signal
	-acknowledge (A) or not-acknowledge (N)
		-all data byte transmissions must be acknowledged or not-acknowledged by the receiver
		-ACK
			-the receiver will pull the data line low
		-NACK
			-the reciever will release the data line


-open drain
	-aka open collector
	-digital output is connected to the base
	-emitter is connected to ground
	-output is open circuit (pull up to high) or (connected to ground (wat))
		-external pull up resistor
			-when trans is on, output is forced to nearly 0 volts
	-uses
		-changing voltage levels between families of chips
		-more than one OpenD can be connected to a single line
			-pull up resistor will keep it high
			-otherwise it can be driven low by another OpenD
