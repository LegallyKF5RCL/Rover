-each device has an address
	-master always initiates transfer

-SDAx and SCLx must have an open drain
	-because they are bi-directional
	-both lines are open drain

-speeds
	-10kbits 	low speed mode
	-100kbits	high speed mode
	-400kbits	fast mode
	-1Mbits		fast mode plus
	-3.4Mbits	High speed 

-however these speeds include overheads such as (not actual data transmission)
	-slave address
	-maybe a register address
	-per byte ACK/NACK bits (which probably means some sort of acknowledge thing)

-nodes
	-limited by the address space

-transmission distance
	-the bus has a total capacitance of 400pF
		-which limits comms to a few meters (I though it was inches)

-master and slave
	-master node

-addressing
	-7 bit
	-10 bit
	-16 bit on some devices



-open drain
	-aka open collector
	-digital output is connected to the base
	-emitter is connected to ground
	-output is open circuit (pull up to high) or (connected to ground (wat))
		-external pull up resistor
			-when trans is on, output is forced to nearly 0 volts
	-uses
		-changing voltage levels between families of chips
		-more than one OpenD can be connected to a single line
			-pull up resistor will keep it high
			-otherwise it can be driven low by another OpenD
